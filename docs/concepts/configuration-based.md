# Configuration Based

MLApp development of models' process encourages configured-based models. This means that all the decisions you are making in your asset are made mostly via configuration.

This allows you to build powerful assets that don't require code adjustments each time you are making a different decision in your model. This scales up the tuning process to your models substantially. 

When your models are configured-based you are taking the full advantage of the cloud where resources are abundant - you can run your models with multiple configurations and promote the best one.

It also allows the reusability of your asset to different scenerios, e.g. Business Units that require each a configuration adjustment with your asset.
