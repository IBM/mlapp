# Introduction

After finishing the Crash Course, you have a gained knowledge for the basic usage of the MLApp framework. 

In this part you will be diving deeper into the framework and create a more advanced model.

This model will be consisted of 2 different sub-models, one classification model boilerplate available from MLApp and the other model is the same one you built in the crash course (with some modifications).

The main idea behind this is to have both the classification model classify the data and the model built in the crash course.

Afterwards you'll be running a final model that will ensemble these two sub-models together in order to take advantage of both sub-models and have a powerful classifer for the glass dataset.
