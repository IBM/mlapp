# Introduction

MLApp Control Panel is a basic MLOps platform.

In it, data scientists can manage their models - from sending jobs that run models to comparing models and promoting the best model. 

<br/>
The Control Panel is docker containerized, which means it is easily portable to any machine or cloud.

It is also possible to run it simply on your local computer using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

You can check our local setup instructions [here](/integrations/external-services/cp-local-setup).
