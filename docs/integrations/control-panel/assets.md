# Managing Assets

### 1. Registering an Asset

When you build an asset with MLApp and want to register it in the Control Panel click on the **Register a New Asset** button. 
![assets-screen](/integrations/control-panel/imgs/assets-screen.png)

Here you can name the asset in the Control Panel, and give for each pipeline a default template configuration.
![register-asset](/integrations/control-panel/imgs/assets-register.png)

Make sure you check the **Enabled** checkbox and hit the **Save** button.

### 2. Enabled/Disabled Assets

You can also Enable/Disable assets you add, and filter by this option here:
![assets-disabled](/integrations/control-panel/imgs/assets-disabled.png)

Notice that we have our _MLApp_'s [Model Boilerplates](/model-boilerplates/introduction/) in the disabled assets.

If you installed any **Boilerplate** you can always click on any row and enable it.
