# Introduction to the MLApp Docs

Welcome! These docs exist to help you learn about how to use MLApp, from your first project setup to asset boilerplates and integrations.

## What is MLApp?

The MLApp project was founded in 2017 as an internal initiative to help IBM data scientists more quickly and consistently create data science solutions for mid-size and large enterprise clients. MLApp evolved substantially over time after learnings from dozens of engagements, and the project was finally open sourced in 2021 in order to share our best practices with the wider community.

MLApp addresses the following observations:

1. Organizations today are demanding data science solutions that are highly customized to their specific business needs. This often means building custom solutions when buying something out of the box doesn't meet the business requirements.
2. At the same time, organizations have less tolerance for science experiments that need to be rebuilt and rearchitected from the ground up in order to be deployed in production and supported over time.
3. Data scientists often do not have the time, interest or background to deal with all of the requirements for their solutions to be considered "production-grade".

MLApp solves this problem by making it much easier for data science teams to develop production-grade data science solutions.

## What kind of use cases can be built in MLApp?

Any data science solution that can be tackled in Python can be built using MLApp - so just about anything! MLApp has been used for use cases from classical machine learning to deep learning, NLP and optimization.

## Assumptions

These docs assume that you are already comfortable with [Python in the context of data science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis). Additionally, you should be comfortable with common Python data science packages like Pandas, Python IDEs and git. If you aren't quite there, we recommend taking some free online courses. Here are some good ones recommended by the MLApp development team:

- [Introduction to Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCriSKVV_8)
- [PyCharm video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP), in particular [Code Navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmTo5xTRka8&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP&index=6), [Debugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJtWxm12Eo0&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP&index=7) and [VCS topics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFnYQbUZQlA&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP&index=11)
- [Git crash course](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)
