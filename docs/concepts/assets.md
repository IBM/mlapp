# Assets

## 1. What is an Asset

A MLapp's asset is a scaffolding of files and code required to develop your model.

This scaffolding is used to connect with the MLApp framework and have your model portable, scalable and reusable.

## 2. Creating an Asset

Creating the asset scaffolding is easy using the MLApp's CLI, just run this command from your root project directory:

```bash
mlapp assets create <asset_name>
```

A new asset will be created with the name <_asset_name_>.
